*** IPNI Definition ***

The Interplanetary Network Indexer[IPNI] is the most comprehensive source of content on Filecoin and IPFS. It's the single largest collection of data addressed by Content Identifiers(CIDs) on the network which exists to help connect you to where the data is stored. 

*** Why IPNI ***

The IPNI is a highly optimized lookup engine designed to gather the most up to date details of data stored in Filecoin and on IPFS, and then provide a fast lookup through a simple API that makes finding content on Filecoin and IPFS easy and efficient. IPNI was designed with the scale of Filecoin in mind to work alongside the Kademlia-DHT and other future content routing systems as a source of truth where to find the data you're looking for. 

For Storage providers or large repositories of IPFS data IPNI also represents the most efficient way to advertise the location of your content and ensure that users can find it. IPNI can be run as a component of the EIPFS implementation, or as a party to the Boost software run by Storage Providers on Filecoin. Currently the primary IPNI implementation is https://cid.contact, but IPNI is presently working towards operating as a federated network of nodes that will distribute content lookups closer to the source data that retrieval clients are looking for.
